# JavaScript Projects

This repository brings together various projects I've developed using **HTML**, **CSS** and **pure JavaScript**, as part of my learning process and evolution as a front-end developer.

The main idea is to centralize the small and medium projects I've developed in a single place, making them easier to view and access.

## Accessing via Docker

You can access the projects from a public Docker image by following these steps:

1. Download the image locally:
```bash
docker pull viniciuscassemira/js-projects:latest
```

2. Create a container with the image:
```bash
docker run -dp 8080:80 --name js-projs viniciuscassemira/js-projects:latest
```

3. Access in your browser:
```bash
http://localhost:8080
```

> Due to the simplicity of the projects, all were dockerized within the same image. To access a specific one, simply select it from the home page when accessing it.
